      Artists • Functional programming is not all about the function keyword • A
      procedure is a collection of things to do in a program • A real function
      must take in inputs and return an output • If a function calls a
      procedure, it becomes a procedure itself • Tuple - two elements in an
      array • Side effects should be avoided in functional programming. Side
      effects are indirect Inputs(or simply side causes) or indirect outputs of
      a function. A function has to take direct inputs and return a value
      without assigning it to any value outside of itself (this is how to avoid
      side effects because they invalidate the idea of functions) • AVOID SIDE
      EFFECTS WITH FINV=CTION CALLS if possible* • Side Effects: I/O(console,
      files, etc.), database storage, network calls, DOM, timestamps, random
      numbers, CPU HEAT, CPU TIME DELAY • Since eliminating side effects
      completely is theoretically impossible, the aim is to minimize side
      effects and make them obvious when present • A PURE FUNCTION takes direct
      inputs, returns direct output(s), and has no side effects. Not only does
      the function matter, but also does the function call. • A pure function
      should always give the same output when given the same input. • FUNCTION
      PURITY is proportional to LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE. Maintaining the purity of
      function calls is more important than maintaining the purity of function
      definitions. • Making side effects obvious makes it easier to maintain
